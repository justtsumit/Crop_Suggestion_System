Project Title:

Crop Suggestion System

Problem Statement:

Many farmers are not sure which crop is suitable for their soil and season
If they choose the wrong crop, they may face low production or loss
To solve this small problem, I am making a simple Python program that helps in suggesting crops based on soil type, season, and budget

Aim of the Project:

The aim of this project is to create a basic program that takes input from the user and shows crops that match the given conditions

Reason for Choosing This Project:

This project is good for practicing Python basics like:
	.	conditions
	.	functions
	.	lists and dictionaries
	.	user input
It also connects with a real-life situation in agriculture

Expected Output:

When the user enters soil type, season, and budget, the program will show a list of suitable crops
If the input is wrong, the program will show an error message

Tools Used:

Python (VS Code)
